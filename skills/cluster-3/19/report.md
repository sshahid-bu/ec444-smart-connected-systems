## Summary

Due to skill changes we now have setup the Pi as a connection to the class-provided router (SLURP_Demo). It is listed as a device on the router and we can access it using it's local IP. 
Any data from the Pi is forwarded on a port and any data received by the Pi must be on specifically configured ports it is programmed to listen from.
