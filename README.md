Hello, I am Shazor Shahid. I keep my repositories organized and well documented.
In general, each skill exists in a cluster subfolder.

------

ESP-IDF workflow:

installed on WSL Ubuntu, ~/esp folder contains IDF and example projects

GitHub repos and skills managed in ~/github/repos

------

> get_idf

sets current directory to work with idf tools

> idf.py -b 115200 -p /dev/ttySXX flash monitor

(where XX is number of port connected through Windows (COMXX))

builds, flashes, and opens SERIAL connection to view and input on ESP32
